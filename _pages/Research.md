My research interests lie in developing novel theoretically justifiable and computationally efficient methods for tackling the computation burden brought about by the sheer size of large-scale datasets. My ongoing research interests are as follows.
* Complex network analysis
* Differential geometry
* Machine Learning in Single molecule biophysics, chemistry and biology
* Nonparametric and Semiparametric Regression
* Microbiome, Metagenomics, Epigenetics, Genomics, Imaging-Genetics
